# 0.0.8

Require >= haml-4.1.0.beta.1 as haml-rails doesn't know about its 5.0 compatibility, yet. You need to use commit , ref: `7c7c169`.

# 0.0.7

Require >= haml-5.0.0.beta2.

# 0.0.6

# 0.0.5

* Remove Haml's buggy `#form_for` version until Haml 4.1 is out, which fixes this by simply not overriding the helper at all. Include `Cell::Haml` after including the form helpers.

# 0.0.4

* Added `capture` helper to override Rails escaping.
